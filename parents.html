                  <p>What I like most about my parents is how supportive they are of me. They are always at my biggest life milestones, whether that be dance recitals or award ceramonies. It always make me feel love and signifcant in their lives.</p>
                  <p>Something my father he appreciates about himself is his unwavering  work ethic. He takes pride in his ability to tackle challenges head-on and persevere until he achieves his goals. My mom cherishes her nurturing nature and her ability to provide unconditional love and support to her family. She takes great satisfaction in creating a warm and loving home environment where everyone feels welcomed and cherished. She will also say friends are welcome to stay over, offer a ride or pick someone up, or make sure everyone has eaten.</p>
