            <hr>
                <p>I think Ziggy he is the cutest cat. He can be a little devil, but he is apart of the family. What I like to most about him is how vocal he is. He is one to strike up coversation in the morning, mostly on how slowly you are at giving him his food. He is very responsive to vistors and he must greet them at the door. </p>
                 <p>Ziggy got his name from the David Bowie persona of Ziggy Stardust and he lives up to it. He is a drama queen, but this personality can only come from his rockstar tendecies. Ziggy loves to put on a show of running around the house and screeching at the top of his lungs. Truely a rockstar. </p>
