            <h2>John and Mikaela </h2>
          <hr>
                <p>My Brother, John, met his girlfriend, Mikaela, in grade 10. Through a mutal friend, they starting dating. They had a group of friends that were all dating, so they thought the best way was to get the to of them together. Ever since then, I have gained a new sibling and I don't think that is changing soon.</p>
                <p>What I like most about John and Mikaela is how determined they are. During Covid they started their own buissness. They make custom shoes! They have had quite a few customers order, as well as taking their products to the Taylor Swift Concerts to sell their swifty merch. I admire how far they have come, from talking about it around the dinner table to have been selling and manfacturing rugs for many. </p>
                <p>When asking John and Mikaela what they like the most about them, they said their accomplishments. They are home-renters and have lived on their own for 2 years now. They are very proud of it. They are also proud that some of their online produce rugs have been in gallery recently, and they were able to sell one of the new rugs as well. </p>
